# Workflows
This is for [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/), an app for Mac that helps with productivity. I highly recommend it.

## Focus
This is for the app from [Brad Jasper](https://twitter.com/bradjasper) called [Focus](http://heyfocus.com). Make sure you use the [alpha build](https://github.com/bradjasper/Focus/blob/master/Builds/Focus-0.9.3-alpha.004.zip?raw=true) or this will not work. It allows you to focus and unfocus from Alfred.
